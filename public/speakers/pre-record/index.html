         <h2 id="how-do-i-submit-my-pre-recorded-video">How do I submit my pre-recorded video?</h2>
<p>You upload a recorded file via the <strong>Next Day Video Presenter Portal</strong> by the due-date (23rd August).  </p>
<p>Links to the portal will be emailed out shortly after you have accepted your talk.  If you have not recieved the link by early July, please contact the organiers.</p>
<p>We keep copies of all uploaded video, so you are welcome to upload improved versions before the due-date.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-if-i-dont-submit-my-video-on-time">What happens if I don't submit my video on time?</h2>
<p>Your talk will revert back to a 'live streaming' talk.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-day-before-your-talk">On the day, before your talk</h2>
<p>Even as a pre-record presenter, we'd love for you to come on our live stage for an introduction and thank-you.</p>
<p>Our community platform will be <a href="https://venueless.org">Venueless</a>; that's where all of our speakers and attendees will be gathering. The videos will feed into there from a video streaming system</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>90 minutes before</strong> your talk, please be on Discord and let us know you're online in #speaker-checkin</li>
<li><strong>60 minutes before</strong> your talk, please request a Tech Check in #tech-check.  The AV team will help you check your set-up, and give last minute advice.</li>
<li><strong>15 minutes before</strong> your talk, the green room AV team will check you are ready. You'll be invited to the streaming backstage for further instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-much-help-will-i-get">How much help will I get?</h2>
<p>Our AV team and volunteers are able to provide tips and advice. However, in most cases we are unable to provide complex support, debug setups, or edit videos for you.</p>
<p>If you want quality or setup feedback before recording your full talk, you can upload a small snippet to the portal, and request in Discord (#tech-check) for an AV team member to look at it and provide feedback. </p>
<h2 id="technical-requirements">Technical requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Video length: A <strong>maximum</strong> of <strong>30 minutes</strong>. It can run a little shorter but it <strong>can not</strong> run longer, even by a second.</li>
<li>Resolution:1080p (1920x1080) or 720p (1280x720)</li>
<li>We can handle format re-conversion, but preference for format is below.</li>
<li>We will email out upload details to those who opt-in to this.</li>
<li>No video intro or outro sequence needed&mdash;if you include one, it may be edited out.</li>
<li>You should be available in the conference Venueless stage during your talk, so you can answer questions!</li>
<li>Editing needs to be done by you, and requesting changes after the due date unlikely. The AV team is expecting to have many hours of video to work through so we likely will not have the capacity to do special pre-event edits ourselves.  You can however request an extension.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preferred-format">Preferred format</h3>
<ul>
<li>Format: MP4 H.264 with AAC audio (Handbrake preset “Youtube HQ 1080 or 720”).</li>
<li>Video Bitrate: At least 2.5mbit for 720p, 4mbit for 1080p.</li>
<li>Audio Bitrate: At least 160kbit, mono or stereo.</li>
<li>File size: Under 4GB</li>
<li>Framerate: 30 (but 29.97/30/50/60 OK too; make sure your <a href="http://urbanvideo.ca/avoid-video-flicker">lights don't flicker</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: If you have multiple presenters, please submit a single video - A/V team has limited capacity for custom edits, we're expecting an edited video ready to broadcast.</p>
