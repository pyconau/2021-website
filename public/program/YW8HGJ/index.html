<div class="lede"><p>Programming is hard, python is hard, but it could be so much easier.</p></div>

<p>Imagine if your students could focus on the important parts of programming in Python, the skill of solving a problem step by step. Imagine if they didn't have to remember the syntax or what functions are there for them to use. Imagine that the debugging was easier because they can see clearly what the program is doing and what the problem is. This talk introduces SplootCode, an interface which lets student write real Python code, with no limitations, without the painful and frustrating parts of learning to code.</p>

    </small>
     <p>Katie's 10+ year career as a software engineer has been pretty darn fun. She helped develop Google Docs and later was on-call for some of Google's biggest cloud infrastructure as a Site Reliability Engineer. She solved some serious technical and operational challenges at Campaign Monitor as lead of the engineering productivity team, and she helped get education startup Grok Learning off the ground as their first employee. Today you'll find her freelancing for startups, as well as working on her own projects. </p>
<p>Fluent in several programming languages, she's at home in both the web browser and deep in the cloud. She's been teaching programming to beginners for a long time, and is now an instructor at General Assembly.</p>
