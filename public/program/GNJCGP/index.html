<div class="lede"><p>Timor-Leste's lingua franca, Tetun, was not on Google Translate or any other free automated translation service. So we embarked on a project to provide this service, starting from zero language resources to building a complete solution, online and free, all in Python!</p></div>

<p>Tetun is the most widely spoken language in Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor). You'll hear it on the streets, on the radio, on TV, and even sung in rap songs. However, one of the main languages of business is English, which many Timorese are eager to learn. Yet there was no free automated translation service between Tetun and English. Therefore, both native Tetun speakers and foreigners learning Tetun were forced to rely on word-for-word translations using dictionaries to translate to and from English. To remedy this, we embarked on a project to create a Tetun-English machine translation service. Itâ€™s now used by over 10,000 people.</p>
<p>Tetun is a low-resource language meaning that there are no readily available corpora (annotated or otherwise), lexica, parallel text and other NLP resources that allow us to easily build models and other AI or NLP products for this language, including a machine translation system. However, advances in research into neural machine translation have allowed us to create a good quality machine translation service even with the modest-sized corpora that we had to develop ourselves.</p>
<p>In this talk we cover how we used Python to create a parallel corpus for training, how we collected and cleaned this data, and trained a neural machine translation encoder-decoder model using Pytorch. Finally, we cover how we serve the machine translation system using a Django web API. We hope that by the end of the talk, you will have a good idea of where to start to create your own machine translation system.</p>
