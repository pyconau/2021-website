<div class="lede"><p>This talk will walk through Python type hints: what they are, why they should be taught. Specifically we  will example how it helps us write better code, and how it can teach a better generation of programmatic thinkers, and design better programs.</p></div>

<p>Python's support for type hints has been increasingly growing over the past several years. </p>
<p>This talk will go over what type hints are, an intro to type theory (and why it can be important to teach) and <strong>specifically</strong> around how type-hints can be used to enable students to understanding better software engineering and critical thinking principles. </p>
<p>This talk is based of my experience in learning about type systems for the first time in a software engineering course at UNSW. From then talking to a few highschool students about how to design certain aspects of their HSC Major Works - I realised that use of type-hints would significantly improve their ability to design and reason about manufacturing programming projects.</p>
