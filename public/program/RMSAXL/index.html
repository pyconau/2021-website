<div class="lede"><p>Everybody knows that the vast majority of security teams are under-resourced and overworked. It is easy to lose hope when the list of things to do keeps growing, the incidents keep coming and gray hair begins to show up!</p>
<p>Don’t lose hope yet! In this talk, we will discuss how a bit of strategy and creativity can go a long way in helping you secure your organisation...on a budget!</p></div>

<p>Cybersecurity is a hot topic these days, but the reality is most companies can’t afford a big security team, buying the shiny things or even having dedicated people to do security work. Most start ups are too busy trying to build something that is worth being secured and big companies are too busy avoiding “snake oil salespeople” (they are the worst!).</p>
<p>In this talk, I will cover many tactics that can be used with little to zero budget. How to scale influence, tools and techniques that can be applied with very little cost and how to do lasting change even in constrained environments.</p>
<p>You will learn how strategy, creativity and kindness can go a long way to secure your organisation and set up you and your team to be more successful in the future!</p>
