<div class="lede"><p>Sounds, words, reading, writing: this is how many people generally develop language skills. In this session, we argue why learning to read code is a game-changer in teaching programming to novice learners and highlight some strategies that can be utilised to develop code reading skills.</p></div>

<p>Navigating a text-based programming language for the first time can be daunting for many learners. While educators support their students with writing code, we argue that learning to read code is equally important. We present some of the existing research in this area, highlighting the numerous benefits of learning to read code. We highlight some easily accessible ways that educators can develop code reading fluency in novice learners, and how these strategies can also provide educators with valuable insights into how their learners are developing their knowledge.</p>
