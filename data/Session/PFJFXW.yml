abstract: "<p>'Add this one line of code to your website to avoid being sued!'</p>\n\
  <p>If you think that that statement sounds like a particularly obnoxious ad, or\
  \ that it must be too good to be true, you're not alone.  However, over the past\
  \ several years, a number of companies popped up with products which claimed to\
  \ do just that.  Their solutions were marketed as a quick and easy way to satisfy\
  \ legislative requirements, and best of all, ensure that your website would be accessible\
  \ to anyone, anywhere.</p>\n<p>And then the lawsuits started.</p>\n<p>Welcome to\
  \ the world of accessibility overlays. According to their creators, they're plug-and-play\
  \ software which remediates accessibility issues on your website, bringing you into\
  \ compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and disability access\
  \ laws instantly.  However, if you ask the disabled people who should be reaping\
  \ the benefits, the answer seems paradoxical: accessibility overlays actually make\
  \ websites <em>less</em> usable for them.</p>\n<p>Why is that?  And how did we get\
  \ to a point where the most prominently advertised solutions for software accessibility\
  \ make the problem worse?  Let's examine this cautionary tale, and find out what\
  \ it can teach us about both accessibility and the principles of good design.</p>"
description: "<p>In 2010, Donna Jodhan won her case against the Canadian government\
  \ for failing to make their government jobs website accessible to blind people.\
  \  Five years later, Coles settled a lawsuit brought by Gisele Mesnage, a screen\
  \ reader user who was unable to use their online shopping website to order her groceries.\
  \  And two years ago, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Domino's\
  \ Pizza against a suit by Guillermo Robles arguing that the Domino's website is\
  \ a place of public accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, sending\
  \ the case back to the lower courts to be decided.  If Robles wins, it could ultimately\
  \ result in companies who do business in the US being required to make their websites\
  \ accessible.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, companies who'd never considered the\
  \ implications of Web accessibility started looking for solutions.  A cottage industry\
  \ of accessibility overlay companies were ready to provide them.</p>\n<p>I first\
  \ encountered accessibility overlays when setting up a new machine, before I'd installed\
  \ my standard ad- and script-blocking software.  As soon as I noticed the wheelchair\
  \ access symbols on websites, and heard the robotic voices telling me which keys\
  \ to press to activate screen reader mode, I realised that I'd read about these\
  \ pieces of software before.  After a couple of hours of research, including reading\
  \ a comprehensive overview of all the lawsuits that has already been filed against\
  \ websites using accessibility overlays, I was finally able to make them go away\
  \ on my new machine once and for all.</p>\n<p>But it's not just the threat of lawsuits\
  \ that resulted in accessibility overlay companies raising large amounts of venture\
  \ capital funding despite the fact that their products do the exact opposite of\
  \ what they claim to.  The way that we architect software and our lack of understanding\
  \ about how disabled people use technology in the first place have contributed to\
  \ a situation where quick fixes sometimes seem like the only option.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this talk, I'll review the ways that people with disabilities have campaigned\
  \ for equal access to life online, and the gains made through the courts in Australia\
  \ and elsewhere.  I'll discuss the reasons why companies use accessibility overlays,\
  \ and the problems that they do and don't fix.  Then, I'll break down the ways in\
  \ which we architect systems, and look at where accessibility should fit into the\
  \ process to make the use of overlays unnecessary.</p>"
