abstract: "<p>Sources: https://github.com/lisushka/overlays</p>\n<p>'Add this one\
  \ line of code to your website to avoid being sued!'</p>\n<p>If you think that that\
  \ statement sounds like a particularly obnoxious ad, or that it must be too good\
  \ to be true, you're not alone.  However, over the past several years, a number\
  \ of companies popped up with products which claimed to do just that.  Their solutions\
  \ were marketed as a quick and easy way to satisfy legislative requirements, and\
  \ best of all, ensure that your website would be accessible to anyone, anywhere.</p>\n\
  <p>And then the lawsuits started.</p>\n<p>Welcome to the world of accessibility\
  \ overlays. According to their creators, they're plug-and-play software which remediates\
  \ accessibility issues on your website, bringing you into compliance with the Web\
  \ Content Accessibility Guidelines and disability access laws instantly.  However,\
  \ if you ask the disabled people who should be reaping the benefits, the answer\
  \ seems paradoxical: accessibility overlays actually make websites <em>less</em>\
  \ usable for them.</p>\n<p>Why is that?  And how did we get to a point where the\
  \ most prominently advertised solutions for software accessibility make the problem\
  \ worse?  Let's examine this cautionary tale, and find out what it can teach us\
  \ about both accessibility and the principles of good design.</p>"
description: "<p>In 2010, Donna Jodhan won her case against the Canadian government\
  \ for failing to make their government jobs website accessible to blind people.\
  \  Five years later, Coles settled a lawsuit brought by Gisele Mesnage, a screen\
  \ reader user who was unable to use their online shopping website to order her groceries.\
  \  And two years ago, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Domino's\
  \ Pizza against a suit by Guillermo Robles arguing that the Domino's website is\
  \ a place of public accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, sending\
  \ the case back to the lower courts to be decided.  If Robles wins, it could ultimately\
  \ result in companies who do business in the US being required to make their websites\
  \ accessible.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, companies who'd never considered the\
  \ implications of Web accessibility started looking for solutions.  A cottage industry\
  \ of accessibility overlay companies were ready to provide them.</p>\n<p>I first\
  \ encountered accessibility overlays when setting up a new machine, before I'd installed\
  \ my standard ad- and script-blocking software.  As soon as I noticed the wheelchair\
  \ access symbols on websites, and heard the robotic voices telling me which keys\
  \ to press to activate screen reader mode, I realised that I'd read about these\
  \ pieces of software before.  After a couple of hours of research, including reading\
  \ a comprehensive overview of all the lawsuits that has already been filed against\
  \ websites using accessibility overlays, I was finally able to make them go away\
  \ on my new machine once and for all.</p>\n<p>But it's not just the threat of lawsuits\
  \ that resulted in accessibility overlay companies raising large amounts of venture\
  \ capital funding despite the fact that their products do the exact opposite of\
  \ what they claim to.  The way that we architect software and our lack of understanding\
  \ about how disabled people use technology in the first place have contributed to\
  \ a situation where quick fixes sometimes seem like the only option.</p>\n<p>In\
  \ this talk, I'll review the ways that people with disabilities have campaigned\
  \ for equal access to life online, and the gains made through the courts in Australia\
  \ and elsewhere.  I'll discuss the reasons why companies use accessibility overlays,\
  \ and the problems that they do and don't fix.  Then, I'll break down the ways in\
  \ which we architect systems, and look at where accessibility should fit into the\
  \ process to make the use of overlays unnecessary.</p>"
