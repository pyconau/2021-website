description: "<p>Time Series is a collection of data points at constant time intervals.\
  \ Time series is one of the important as well as lesser-known fields of machine\
  \ learning. Time series forecasting is very important as many prediction problems\
  \ have a time component. In time series forecasting we analyze the time-dependent\
  \ data for predicting long-term and seasonality trends. Making predictions about\
  \ the future is known as extrapolation in classical statistics. In this talk, we\
  \ will discuss the basic concepts of time series forecasting, various time-series\
  \ forecasting techniques such as Autoregression, Moving Average, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA,\
  \ SARIMAX, VARMA, HWES, and Dickey-Fuller test, and a case study that demonstrates\
  \ the working of time series forecasting techniques on a real-world problem. We\
  \ will discuss how to perform time series forecasting in Python using Pandas and\
  \ statsmodels packages.</p>\n<p>Outline\n1. Introduction to Time Series forecasting\

  \ techniques (15 Minutes)\n3. Case study for Time series forecasting (8 Minutes)\n\
