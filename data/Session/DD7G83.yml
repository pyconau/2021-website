abstract: <p>A look at some of the systems in place today—data sources, algorithms,
  libraries, and pipelines—that manage the growing crisis of space debris and protect
  our critical orbital infrastructure from the ground.</p>
description: "<p>The accumulation of debris in Earth orbit puts critical satellite-based\
  \ infrastructure at risk. Methods of precise tracking and accurate path prediction\
  \ for objects in orbit are required to prevent debris-forming collisions, as well\
  \ as to enable on-orbit satellite repair and debris removal technologies that are\
  \ in early development. </p>\n<p>This tracking and prediction process for objects\
  \ in Earth orbit is known as Space Traffic Management (STM). It's to satellites\
  \ and space junk what Air Traffic Control is to aviation, but more. STM is made\
  \ up of a series of tasks that are each challenging for humans or computers to perform\
  \ for varied reasons: data collection requires high-fidelity analog capture,  data\
  \ processing requires high-volume stream digitisation and transformation without\
  \ precision or information loss, data interpretation requires recognition of ambiguous\
  \ objects, and path extrapolation from current trajectories requires computation\
  \ of complex and fluctuating physical forces with great precision.</p>\n<p>Let's\
  \ talk about what's known about how STM systems work (or don't work) today, how\
  \ you can try some of these steps yourself with Python, and how we can make global\
  \ STM capabilities better with open source.</p>"

cw: <p>This talk contains brief discussion of the military and testing of weapons,
  both in a non-combat context (e.g., firing missiles at uncrewed spacecraft).</p>
