abstract: <p>The CFU-Playground allows anyone to build FPGA based accelerators for
  ML inferencing. With a heavy reliance on the Python based tools LiteX and nMigen,
  it encourages an interative development style, typically starting with a single
  multiply-accumulate, and progressing in small steps to a full inner loop.</p>
description: "<p>This talk describes the CFU Playground, an open-source framework\
  \ that an engineer, intern, or student can use to design and evaluate enhancements\
  \ to an FPGA-based soft RISC-V processor, specifically to increase the performance\
  \ of machine learning (ML) tasks through the addition of custom function units (CFUs).\
  \ The goal is to abstract away most infrastructure details so that the user can\
  \ get up to speed quickly and focus solely on adding new processor functions, exploiting\
  \ them in the computation, and measuring the results.</p>\n<p>The presentation describes\
  \ the process of identifying hot spots in the code during an inference of a specific\
  \ model, then addressing those hotspots by building a CFU in nMigen. We examine\
  \ the process of constructing the gateware building blocks and unittesting them,\
  \ then integrating them with the Tensorflow Lite kernel library. The goal is to\
  \ specialize the RISC-V processor and ML kernels to accelerate the model of interest.</p>\n\
  <p>All IP and software used is open sourced and licensed permissively -- the open\
  \ RISC-V ISA that allows new custom instructions, the VexRiscv soft core implementation,\
  \ the LiteX system-on-chip IP, the Symbiflow FPGA toolchain, Renode and Verilator\
  \ simulators, and TensorFlow Lite kernel libraries.  Thus, the combined CPU, CFU,\
  \ and kernel libraries that the user develops are not tied to any particular FPGA\
  \ vendor; there are no licensing restrictions or fees; and there is no dependence\
  \ on any black box proprietary tools.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/google/CFU-Playground\n\
