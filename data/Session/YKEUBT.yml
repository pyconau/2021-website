abstract: <p>When people think of programming and music, electronic music would probably
  be the first thing that comes to mind. This talk aims to provide some insight into
  a lesser-known field -- composing traditionally notated music in Python with Abjad,
  an algorithmic composition software.</p>
description: "<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p>Although classical music has been moving towards\
  \ a more algorithmic approach since the beginning of the 20th century with the emergence\
  \ of serialism and later with spectral music, composers are not utilising technology\
  \ fully to their advantage. Most notation software offers just a handful of functions\
  \ for composers to manipulate their music, but often they are not enough for any\
  \ elaborate composition process. Although there is a couple of algorithmic composition\
  \ software, the notations generated are often not configurable.</p>\n<h2>Bridging\
  \ the gap</h2>\n<p>Abjad offers a way to bridge the gap between the algorithmic\
  \ composition process and music notation. Since Abjad is a Python module, users\
  \ can utilise functions inside Abjad, built-in Python functions, as well as other\
  \ Python modules such as NumPy. Abjad exposes the users to a huge possibility to\
  \ implement their own composition process in Python. Abjad is also a wrapper of\
  \ the LilyPond music engraving software, which means that it outputs LilyPond code,\
  \ and can call LilyPond to typeset the music.</p>\n<h2>Okay, but what can Abjad\
  \ <em>actually</em> do?</h2>\n<p>To illustrate what Abjad can do, I am planning\
  \ to demonstrate some basic examples of creating music with Abjad.  I am also planning\
  \ to showcase some of the code behind my compositions.</p>\n<h2>Experience of the\
  \ speaker</h2>\n<p>I am passionate about programming and maybe more so, music composition.\
  \  Abjad enables me to indulge myself in both fields.</p>\n<p>I have been an active\
  \ contributor of Abjad and the maintainer of one of its extension package for more\
  \ than half a year.  I have also been using Abjad for my own compositions, having\
  \ completed a solo piano piece and working on a solo flute piece.  Being a user\
  \ as well as a developer gives me a unique insight into the software, not just in\
  \ terms of the software architecture, but also in terms of how to make Abjad more\
  \ composer-friendly.</p>\n<p>I am planning to implement more features on the extension\
  \ package that I am maintaining while using it for my own composition.</p>"
