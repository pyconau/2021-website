abstract: <p>In this talk, I will be discussing Python and GPUs! I will give a brief
  history of Python and parallel computing, take a look at Python’s ‘infamous’ GIL,
  and share how and why Pythonistas can get started with using GPUs to do more work
  faster.</p>
description: "<p>Why GPUs?  </p>\n<p>I will begin with a brief background on the history\
  \ of Python and parallel computing. Some people would call Python a ‘slow language.’\
  \ One of the reasons for this is that it doesn’t readily support parallelism because\
  \ of the GIL. I’ll take a quick look at Python’s ‘infamous’ GIL and how and why\
  \ people have and are still trying to get around it. For this, I will be referencing\
  \ some of my favorite PyCon talks on the subject!  </p>\n<p>For slow, CPU-intensive\
  \ tasks there are several ways to speed up your Python code. Async IO and Numba\
  \ JIT, are some tools that have become quite popular for improving GIL-related performance\
  \ issues. More recently, and as it relates to this talk GPUs have been introduced\
  \ as another way to optimize performance in this regard.   </p>\n<p>What exactly\
  \ is a GPU?  </p>\n<p>Next, I’ll discuss what a GPU is and how it’s being used in\
  \ the world today. Historically GPUs have been used primarily in gaming, but more\
  \ and more people are using them for general-purpose computing. I’ll discuss the\
  \ differences between CPUs and GPUs and share some examples of various ways Pythonistas\
  \ are using GPUs to speed up their workflows. I’m currently interning with the RAPIDS\
  \ team at Nvidia, so I’ll talk a little bit about the work I’m doing there. RAPIDS\
  \ is an open-source library that accelerates data science using GPUs. I’ll demonstrate\
  \ the differences in speed of computation with a GPU and without one. </p>\n<p>How\
  \ can I get started?  </p>\n<p>-Finally, I will end my talk by giving some advice\
  \ about how Pythonistas can start using GPUs either in their work or as a hobby\
  \ in their spare time. Even if you don’t personally own a GPU there are several\
  \ free and affordable resources one can access online. I’ll share some of these\
  \ resources with the audience.</p>"
