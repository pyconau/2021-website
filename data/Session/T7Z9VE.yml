abstract: "<p>Get your finest top hat and dive into the rabbit hole with me for a\
  \ magic trick like only the best snakes can do: create Python modules out of thin\
  \ air. We'll import Python modules that don't exist and yet, Presto, here they are.</p>"
description: <p>Inspired by recent work on an opensource library, we wanted a Python
  framework (Django) to believe there were specific Python modules (migrations) inside
  a folder that was actually empty. This led us to discover the wonderful world of
  Loaders and MetaPathFinders and a whole menagerie of objects and methods and calls.
  In this talk, we'll try and recreate the different steps that we went through, and
  get the opportunity to become friends with the import machinery along the way.</p>
