abstract: "<p>Get your finest top hat and dive into the rabbit hole with me for a\
  \ magic trick like only the best snakes can do: create Python modules out of thin\
  \ air. We'll import Python modules that don't exist and yet, Presto, here they are.</p>"
description: <p>Inspired by recent work on an open-source library, we wanted a Python
  framework (Django) to believe there were specific Python modules (migrations) inside
  a folder that was actually empty. This led us to discover the wonderful world of
  Loaders and MetaPathFinders and a whole menagerie of objects and methods and calls
  in the Python import machinery. In this talk, we'll try and recreate the different
  steps that we went through, and get the opportunity to become friends with the import
  machinery along the way.</p>
