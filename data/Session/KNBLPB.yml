abstract: <p>Join us for 6 fantastic short talks from high school students! You'll
  learn about Renewable Hearing, Kookaberry apps, 3D Games with Pygame, AI on the
  Twitter Timeline, Python metaprogramming through bytecode, and Deblurring with Deep
  Learning.</p>
description: "<h2>Renewable Hearing - Liv Anne Heaton</h2>\n<p>I am building a hearing\
  \ aid that can run on solar charged batteries, powered by Raspberry Pi Pico and\
  \ Circuitpython. It features a fast Fourier transform that is required for altering\
  \ the volume for different frequencies. What has worked so far is the Fourier algorithm\
  \ and calculating the decibels from the input. An accessible user interface is still\
  \ required, and the hardest part is definitely the signal processing from the audio\
  \ in to the audio out. Live or pre-recorded is fine!</p>\n<h2>Making an isometric\
  \ 3D game from scratch in python's Pygame - Samuel Price</h2>\n<p>I have made a\
  \ game with isometric 3D from the 2D graphics engine pygame in python. This game\
  \ uses a series of menus to decided the parameters for a simulation of a basic ecosystem\
  \ with noise generated terrain. This game is fully operational, as are a few other\
  \ of my isometric 3D demos. In addition, I also created a small program to help\
  \ me to draw the 3D models. Come to this talk to learn about the how and why!</p>\n\
  <h2>Tweet Aware, using AI to deconstruct your Twitter timeline - Bella Ryan</h2>\n\
  <p>Tweet Aware' is my year 12 major project for software design development. I built\
  \ a python program that reconstructs a users feed using the Twitter API and then\
  \ performs sentiment analysis on it. It is a really cool project that went through\
  \ a few phases of this would be super cool! - but doesn't quite work, damn. In my\
  \ presentation I will show my design process for the overall project as well as\
  \ my tinkering with the API to get a result I am happy with.</p>\n<h2>Python metaprogramming\
  \ through bytecode -Jonte Deakin</h2>\n<p>This talk is about my project bytecodemacro.\
  \ It is a python library which allows for easy metaprogramming through making use\
  \ of a human readable version of python bytecode which can be manipulated to very\
  \ cool effects! Here is a link to the Github: https://github.com/Glubs9/bytecodemacro\
  \ </p>\n<p>This worked really well and it enabled me to do lots of cool things!</p>\n\
  <p>The hardest part of this project was the intentional lack of documentation around\
  \ bytecode. The python developers intentionally leave the documentation sparse so\
  \ it was quite hard to understand! The other issue I had is that python code objects\
  \ (python functions fall under this) are immutable, which is an issue because if\
  \ you want to make a recursive function you need to give the immutable object a\
  \ reference to itself! This was solved by emulating pointer behaviour by using python\
  \ lists which are stored by reference in the code object, thus getting around the\
  \ immutability.</p>\n<h2>Deblurring with Deep Learning - Manindra de Mel</h2>\n\
  <p>Deep learning has several complex and interesting mathematics underlying it.\
  \ I will be exploring my journey utilising Deep learning to deblur images. Furthermore,\
  \ I will discuss the problems I overcame to create a working image de-blurring program.\
  \ Specifically overcoming problems such as, understanding and implementing the mathematics,\
  \ choosing the most optimal training method and the hardest problem being fixing\
  \ the several logical errors found within the program. Included in the presentation\
  \ will also be a  demo of the program de-blurring an imagine live.</p>\n<h2>Kookaberry\
  \ apps for learning - Amelia McLaren, Dalia Hamade, Vianne Stavliotis, Elizabeth\
  \ Park</h2>\n<p>Given some Kookaberries and some input and output devices we were\
  \ challenged to create embedded device apps that assist the user in the pursuit\
  \ of learning or leisure. Some of us decided to code something to help with studying\
  \ for school, while others coded something aimed towards learning musical instruments.\
  \ Some of the apps for musicians  include a metronome or song practice counter.\
  \ Meanwhile apps that would help with school studies included a timetable, pop quiz,\
  \ study timer along with flashcards and a motivational quote displayer. Overall,\
  \ each app that we created was effective and reached our aim.</p>\n<p>The majority\
  \ of our original ideas for our apps ended up being a success as we put lots of\
  \ time into brainstorming reasonable and useful embedded systems. Because of this,\
  \ we were all able to spend more time on the actual code for these ideas. Something\
  \ that worked well for us was being able to use python. Python was useful for example\
  \ because it let us simplify our code so that it didn’t look bulky and overwhelming.\
  \ We had also been learning about python for the rest of the semester, so it gave\
  \ us a chance to try and apply our theory to an actual project. </p>\n<p>There were\
  \ a few tricky parts in making our projects, but we overcame them with the help\
  \ of our teacher and our other classmates.The hardest parts for the majority of\
  \ people were bugs in the code, for example, it was difficult to locate the code\
  \ sometimes and try to fix it without changing the parts of the code that did work.\
  \ \nSometimes the code would be in the wrong place and other times we could not\
  \ figure out how to code something by ourselves. This makes sense considering that\
  \ we are all new to python this year. Specific examples include, not being able\
  \ to switch from different display interfaces without messing up the other code,\
  \ recognising simple errors and mistakes, and problem solving difficult parts of\
  \ the code.</p>\n<p>With all the obstacles that we faced, we all overcame them by\
  \ working hard and asking for help. Our teacher Ms Noble assisted us with our code,\
  \ she helped us compact our code so that it didn’t look chunky and also helped when\
  \ we couldn’t figure out what was wrong after looking over the code many times.\
  \ She also provided a cheat sheet for us on how to use Python with the Kookaberry.\
  \ This cheat sheet helped us a lot since we had to include a bit more coding for\
  \ the kookaberry part. We also asked each other when we were stuck on a particular\
  \ code and worked together to form resolutions.\"</p>"
