description: "<p>Optimising for multiple objectives is a non-trivial task, especially\
  \ when they are in conflict. For example, how can one best overcome the classic\
  \ trade-off between quality and cost of production, when the monetary value of quality\
  \ is not defined? In this talk you will learn about Pareto Fronts and how they can\
  \ be used to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously.  </p>\n<p>When applicable,\
  \ this Pareto Optimisation method provides better results than the common practice\
  \ of combining multiple parameters into a single parameter heuristic. The reason\
  \ for this is quite simple. The single heuristic approach is like horse binders\
  \ limiting the view of the solution space, whereas Pareto Optimisation enables a\
  \ bird’s eye view.</p>\n<p>Real world applications span from supply chain management,\
  \ manufacturing, aircraft design to land use planning and therapeutics discovery.</p>\n\
  <p>This introduction is geared towards anyone who makes data driven decisions or\
  \ is interested in improving their optimisation skills. You will learn the advantages\
  \ and shortcomings of the technique and be able to assess applicability for your\
  \ own projects.</p>\n<p>Specifically I will demonstrate that the Python package\
  \ <a href=\"https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/\">DEAP</a>  is a useful tool\
  \ for prototyping for solutions in large intractable spaces, such as DNA combinatorial\
  \ spaces, which require stochastic search techniques such as Genetic Algorithms.</p>"
