abstract: "<p>What is a decorator? You might say it's a function that accepts a function\
  \ and returns a function. That's wrong.</p>\n<p>So what's the right answer?</p>\n\
  <p>Join us for a deep (but standard talk-length) dive into decorators!  You’ll learn\
  \ what decorators actually are, how they work, how to write your own decorators,\
  \ and how decorators enable you to do extremely weird things in Python. Most importantly,\
  \ you’ll understand how to use decorators responsibly, and definitely not to confuse\
  \ your friends and colleagues.</p>"
description: "<p>One of the most fraught questions in Python is “What is a decorator?”</p>\n\
  <p>To a new Python developer, it’s a thing with an <code>@</code> symbol that changes\
  \ the behaviour of a function or method. To people who want to understand how they\
  \ work, decorators are functions that change the behaviours of functions by returning\
  \ new functions.</p>\n<p>These definitions are simple, easy to understand, and wrong.</p>\n\
  <p>Decorators like <code>@wraps</code> or <code>@classmethod</code> change the behaviour\
  \ of a callable, and do so by returning a new callable. Other decorators, like <code>@property</code>\
  \ accept a callable, but leave something completely different in their place. </p>\n\
  <p>This flexibility isn’t just there for decorators that come with Python. You can\
  \ use this flexibility in your own decorators, and it offers the potential for you\
  \ to build interesting and unexpected new behaviour.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll\
  \ look at why Python has decorators, and how you can build them. </p>\n<p>We’ll\
  \ look at how some more popular decorators in Python do what they do. Finally, we’ll\
  \ look at how to harness decorators to do unexpected and potentially horrible things\
  \ with Python.</p>\n<p>After this talk, you’ll know how decorators work, how to\
  \ write your own decorators, and how decorators enable you to do extremely weird\
  \ things in Python. Most importantly, you’ll understand how to use decorators responsibly,\
  \ and definitely not to confuse your friends and colleagues.</p>"
