abstract: <p>So you’re a software developer, now what? Is it satisfying? How do you
  level up? How can you influence your career direction? How can you even figure out
  what you want?</p>
description: "<p>If your manager asked where you want your career to go, do you know\
  \ what you would say? Do you feel like being a developer is a bit “meh”, but you\
  \ are not really sure what else is out there? If career questions make you feel\
  \ a bit lost, you’re not alone. It’s common for software developers to feel that\
  \ their career is something that happens <em>to</em> them while they scramble for\
  \ job stability, rather than something that they have any influence or control over.\
  \ </p>\n<p>This talk will challenge you to look sideways when it comes to moving\
  \ on up. Software is so much more than just programming, even if you still program\
  \ every day. Come to get some new ideas on what your current or next job might look\
  \ like, and how to figure out what you might like. Leave with some confident directions\
  \ to guide your next 1:1 discussion or job search. </p>\n<p>Software is a generous\
  \ and expansive field - why not aim to find fulfilling work while we’re here, hey?</p>"
