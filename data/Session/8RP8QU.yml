abstract: '<p>This talk will walk through Python type hints: what they are, why they
  should be taught. Specifically we  will example how it helps us write better code,
  and how it can teach a better generation of programmatic thinkers, and design better
  programs.</p>'
description: "<p>Python's support for type hints has been increasingly growing over\
  \ the past several years. </p>\n<p>This talk will go over what type hints are, an\
  \ intro to type theory (and why it can be important to teach) and <strong>specifically</strong>\
  \ around how type-hints can be used to enable students to understanding better software\
  \ engineering and critical thinking principles. </p>\n<p>This talk is based of my\
  \ experience in learning about type systems for the first time in a software engineering\
  \ course at UNSW. From then talking to a few highschool students about how to design\
  \ certain aspects of their HSC Major Works - I realised that use of type-hints would\
  \ significantly improve their ability to design and reason about manufacturing programming\
  \ projects.</p>"
