abstract: <p>What is audio data? How to build features and classification models on
  audio? How to solve audio classification problems in python? This talk will answer
  all those questions and highlight the challenges in classifying using audio, the
  features that work well with audio and speech data and extracting them, the open-source
  tools in Python that can be leveraged and some usage examples and applications.</p>
description: <p>Unlike types of data that are more commonly dealt with in the industry
  these days, such as numerical data, text or image data, audio signals need a different
  approach while trying to extract information and building machine learning models.
  This talk will highlight the challenges with Audio Classification problems starting
  with what an audio signal is and what its numerical representation means, how it
  is widely different from other data types, what feature extraction from audio looks
  like, how to go about it, what it means and the open source tools in Python that
  can be leveraged for solving an end-to-end audio classification problem. Digital
  signal processing, that includes audio processing, is a whole separate field to
  study and leveraging portions of learning from that in order to build successful
  models on audio data is an interesting and challenging problem. In addition, Matlab
  is a popular language of choice with great tools for audio signal processing. Python
  being a popular language of choice for Machine Learning presents another set of
  challenges to build successful audio and speech classification solutions in Python
  alone. Focus will then upon how to build classification models from the features
  representing the unseen information from audio and speech signals and doing it all
  leveraging different open source tools available to Python users. This will be followed
  by a few examples of different audio classification and prediction tasks and a solution
  for attempting to solve them using Python using the different features formation
  techniques and tools discussed earlier in the talk.</p>
