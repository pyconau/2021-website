abstract: "<p>Teaching a programming language can be challenging, even more so when\
  \ your classroom is suddenly virtual and you have to teach 1200 students. With some\
  \ clever thinking our multidisciplinary teaching team turned this crisis to our\
  \ advantage and achieved an all time high level of student satisfaction. We are\
  \ now able to reach any student, no matter their location, timezone or computing\
  \ device with a real-time collaborative coding environment.</p>\n<p>This talk will\
  \ cover what we consider “must-haves” for teaching in these extreme circumstances\
  \ and how we have been able to maintain student engagement. We will demonstrate\
  \ our solution to hosting tutorials online and share the lessons we learnt along\
  \ the way.</p>"
description: "<p>We teach Python as part of an introductory Data Science unit for\
  \ post-graduate students. This unit has dramatically grown in popularity due to\
  \ the demand for data science education.</p>\n<p>In Semester 1 of 2020, we experienced\
  \ a significant crisis situation where over 80% of our 800 students were unable\
  \ to travel to Australia due to COVID. We quickly discovered that our prior teaching\
  \ practice was inadequate when teaching over Zoom. The situation for Semester 2\
  \ was dire, with an expected 1200 students. So we outlined our requirements and\
  \ searched for a solution.</p>\n<p>With some clever thinking our multidisciplinary\
  \ teaching team turned this crisis to our advantage and achieved an all time high\
  \ level of student satisfaction. We are now able to reach any student, no matter\
  \ their location, timezone or computing device with a real-time collaborative coding\
  \ environment. </p>\n<p>This talk will cover what we consider “must-haves” for teaching\
  \ in these extreme circumstances and how we have been able to maintain student engagement.\
