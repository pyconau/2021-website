abstract: <p>What do you do when two minutes into ticket sales, your website keels
  over? When overwhelmed with errors, how can you begin to find the root cause? Or
  worse, what happens when there is no single root cause?</p>
description: '<p>Come and explore a recent #hugops case study, where customer demand
  was high, service availability was low, and stressed sysadmins and devs were frantically
  trying to get everything up and running again. Along this journey weâ€™ll be visiting
  MySQL, NodeJS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Linux, to try and piece together the causes
  behind a real-world service outage earlier this year, and how to prevent it from
  happening again.</p>'
