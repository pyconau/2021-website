abstract: "<p>Graphs are amazing: there's the emerging graph ML work in deep learning,\
  \ the rise of knowledge graphs in industry, powerful graph algorithms, ginormous\
  \ graph databases, interactive graph visualizations, and so on. While these might\
  \ seem to require special platforms and specialized expertise, in fact there's so\
  \ much that can be done with graph-based technologies in Python. A team of open\
  \ source developers has been working on <a href=\"https://github.com/DerwenAI/kglab\"\
  ><code>kglab</code></a> to integrate many different libraries related to graph work\
  \ into an abstraction that plays well with popular data science tools in Python:\
  \ pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Parquet, spaCy, PyTorch, RAPIDS, etc. This session\
  \ will introduce <em>Graph Data Science</em>, showing how you can leverage these\
  \ techniques into your data analytics work.</p>"
description: "<p>Graphs are amazing: there's the emerging graph ML work in deep learning,\
  \ the rise of knowledge graphs in industry, semantic technologies, powerful graph\
  \ algorithms, ginormous graph databases, statistical relational learning with probabilistic\
  \ graphs, interactive graph visualizations, and so on.  While these different \"\
  camps\" among graph experts have typically not shared much common ground, and often\
  \ required special platforms, that's changed.</p>\n<p>A team of open source developers\

  \ to integrate many different libraries related to graph work into an abstraction\
  \ that plays well with popular data science tools in Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn,\
  \ Parquet, spaCy, PyTorch, RAPIDS, etc. Moreover, the graph abstraction layer is\
  \ engineered to follow data engineering practices and integrate with popular distributed\
  \ systems for scale-out.</p>\n<p>This session will introduce <em>Graph Data Science</em>,\
  \ showing how you can leverage these techniques into your data analytics work. We'll\
  \ show a demo using an open dataset from Kaggle which has a large number of recipes,\
  \ for a progressive example of graph data science: data preparation, queries, visualizations,\
  \ inference, etc., as components of a self-supervised pipeline in Python. The intent\
  \ is to provide integrations for many complementary techniques where one can \"\
  mix &amp; match\" to build Hybrid AI solutions.  Not much code, with all code samples\
  \ wrapped as Jupyter notebooks that will run on a laptop. Most of it should feel\
  \ quite familiar to anyone who works with <code>pandas.</code></p>"
