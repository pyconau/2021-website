abstract: <p>SLOs, OKRs, and any metrics are only as good as the processes that allow
  people to advocate for data-driven approaches, and getting businesses set up to
  leverage their data for good (enablement) rather than evil (blame) is a big part
  of Engineering and DevOps maturity.</p>
description: "<p>This talk walks through the pitfalls of setting the wrong goals and\
  \ measuring metrics that drive poor outcomes and follows the story of looking for\
  \ a way to balance the powers of engineering and product with sensible checks and\
  \ balances born from data. \nIt's a journey of what I have learned and discovered,\
  \ mistakes I've made, and how to turn data into a business driver, and the DevOps\
  \ teams who facilitate that data, into business influencers.\nThis talk discusses\
  \ how we can leverage metrics like SLOs for good (enablement) rather than evil (blame)\
  \ and the place DevOps has in the wider Engineering team &amp; Business decision-making\
  \ structure.</p>"
