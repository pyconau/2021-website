abstract: "<p>Everybody knows that the vast majority of security teams are under-resourced\
  \ and overworked. It is easy to lose hope when the list of things to do keeps growing,\
  \ the incidents keep coming and gray hair begins to show up!</p>\n<p>Don’t lose\
  \ hope yet! In this talk, we will discuss how a bit of strategy and creativity can\
  \ go a long way in helping you secure your organisation...on a budget!</p>"
description: "<p>Cybersecurity is a hot topic these days, but the reality is most\
  \ companies can’t afford a big security team, buying the shiny things or even having\
  \ dedicated people to do security work. Most start ups are too busy trying to build\
  \ something that is worth being secured and big companies are too busy avoiding\
  \ “snake oil salespeople” (they are the worst!).</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will cover\
  \ many tactics that can be used with little to zero budget. How to scale influence,\
  \ tools and techniques that can be applied with very little cost and how to do lasting\
  \ change even in constrained environments.</p>\n<p>You will learn how strategy,\
  \ creativity and kindness can go a long way to secure your organisation and set\
  \ up you and your team to be more successful in the future!</p>"
