abstract: <p>Abstract Syntax Trees are a tool for analysing and manipulating the structure
  and function of code. They can be used to do about a million different useful and
  smart things. This talk is not about those things.</p>
description: "<p>Did you ever get an idea that is so stupid you couldn't think about\
  \ anything else until you'd made it real? In this talk I'll show you how I implemented\
  \ what I think is probably the worst idea I've ever had: Using genetic programming\
  \ to write code.</p>\n<p>Abstract Syntax Trees allow you to parse code into a tree-like\
  \ structure, with each node in the tree representing an operation or a variable.\
  \ They're used for little things like syntax highlighting in your IDE, as well as\
  \ fundamental things like compiling your code at runtime. Recent releases of Python\
  \ have included substantial improvements to the core AST library.</p>\n<p>Genetic\
  \ programming is a slightly unfashionable technique from data science which \"evolves\"\
  \ solutions to problems by randomly combining and mutating programs until a \"fit\"\
  \ solution is found. Typically the programs involve a very tightly-controlled set\
  \ of mathematical operators in a tree-like structure.</p>\n<p>You can see where\
  \ this is going. Can you use genetic programming techniques to combine and mutate\
  \ abstract syntax trees? Can you evolve programs that produce working code? Can\
  \ you actually solve a real-life problem using this approach? The answer to all\
  \ these questions is \"No, don't be stupid.\" But I gave it a crack anyway.</p>"
