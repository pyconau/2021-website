abstract: <p>If a customer was hopping mad overnight, but your monitoring dashboard
  shows its usual green line at 99.5% superb, you might expect to spend your morning
  wading through logs… but what if you could find out what was happening in a few
  minutes? Better yet, what if you knew before they did?</p>
description: "<p>For years, I've barely touched logs: I've instead used structured\
  \ events and tracing to find the source of someone's trouble and list everyone else\
  \ affected.  It used to require custom code, but you can do it with open source:\
  \ <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io\">OpenTelemetry</a> is an ambitious attempt\
  \ to standardise application tracing across all languages, frameworks, packages,\
  \ and deployment environments.</p>\n<p>In this talk you'll learn how to measure\
  \ your Python's behaviour with OpenTelemetry, how to solve production mysteries,\
  \ and how to monitor service level indicators for advance warning of trouble.</p>"
