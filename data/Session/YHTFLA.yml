abstract: <p>Presentation on using pyenv, virtual environments, and pipx to build
  an easy-to-manage Python development setup. Setup, where you can easily switch between
  different Python versions, and you don't have to worry about messing up packages
  in your projects.</p>
description: "<p>Managing Python versions and dependencies can be painful. JavaScript\
  \ developers have their \"node_modules\" folders, but we don't have \"python_modules\"\
  \ (yet!) in Python. Instead, we have those mysterious virtual environments. And\
  \ if you also want to switch between different Python versions, it can quickly turn\
  \ into a mess.</p>\n<p>It doesn't have to be that way. With a few simple tools and\
  \ practices, you can easily tame Python and its dependencies. In this talk, I'm\
  \ going to show you how to do this.</p>\n<p>I will talk about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How\
  \ to manage Python versions with pyenv and set different versions for a folder or\
  \ a shell session?</li>\n<li>What are virtual environments, what's the difference\
  \ between different tools (venv, virtualenvwrapper, conda, etc.), and how to use\
  \ them?</li>\n<li>How to separate global packages with pipx (and why you should\
  \ do this)</li>\n</ul>"
