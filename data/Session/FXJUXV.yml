abstract: '<p>PyLadies Brazil, largest PyLadies chapter of the world (in number of
  chapters), is a combination of hard work: from the ladies who manage and organize
  both local and national groups, and also from the Brazilian Python community. But
  how did we get there? Come to see us saying “this is how we do!”</p>'
description: <p>Initiatives concerned about gender disparity have been gaining strength
  internationally in recent years, and the Brazilian open-source community has stood
  out in the quantity and effectiveness of actions aimed at these projects, changing
  the scenario of our regional and national conferences and events. Here in Brazil,
  the largest country in South America, we also have the biggest PyLadies community
  of the world (in number of chapters), with about 30 chapters around the country.
  But how did we get here? How do we manage to have such a huge group of people working
  together and specially learning from each other to run our activities so organically?
  In this lecture we will talk about our experience with PyLadies in different regions
  in Brazil, where we will summarize some of the history of the creation of PyLadies
  Brazil, how everything started and the path we follow to this day. During the talk,
  we’ll learn more about how do we get ladies (and gentlemen) to work together for
  these changes to happen, also how the organizers of the chapters and workshops communicate
  in order to improve their routines and activities and finally the annual experience
  sharing meeting we have to gather people who represent the groups to brainstorm
  ideas of how to make our community better. It will be mentioned the construction
  and exchange that takes place within our community and with the diverse communities
  that support us in the most various corners of the country, their particularities,
  difficulties and results.</p>
