abstract: <p>Programming is hard, python is hard, but it could be so much easier.</p>
description: <p>Imagine if your students could focus on the important parts of programming
  in Python, the skill of solving a problem step by step. Imagine if they didn't have
  to remember the syntax or what functions are there for them to use. Imagine that
  the debugging was easier because they can see clearly what the program is doing
  and what the problem is. This talk introduces SplootCode, an interface which lets
  student write real Python code, with no limitations, without the painful and frustrating
  parts of learning to code.</p>
