abstract: <p>What can we learn from decades of research on collapsology, the study
  of industrial civilizations collapsing? What do ancient civilizations have in common
  with security culture? The answer is a lot more than you think, and it doesn't even
  involve patching! So come along to discover what we can learn about identifying
  risks and threats in our security culture. Because if you aren't hacking it, who
  is?</p>
description: "<p>For decades, anthropologists, quantitative historians, and sociologists\
  \ have discussed and proposed various explanations for the collapse of civilizations,\
  \ from unsustainable complexity, decay of social cohesion, rising inequality and\
  \ general misfortune.</p>\n<p>Using our time-travelling phone booth, we’ll investigate\
  \ historical collapses and conduct a root cause analysis to investigate why these\
  \ collapses happened, and how we can observe similar issues in modern business environments.</p>\n\
  <p>This talk provides an overview of how to identify cultural threats in a rapidly\
  \ evolving business landscape, and how we can use modern-day tools to identify these\
  \ threats before they result in security culture collapse.</p>"
