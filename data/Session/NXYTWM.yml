abstract: "<p>I’ve been a big fan of the BBC micro:bit for years now, but then I heard\
  \ there was a <em>new Aussie kid</em> on the <em>embedded systems block</em>, the\
  \ “Kookaberry”. I was interested to hear more but skeptical that it could lure me\
  \ away from the micro:bit lifestyle where I’d invested my time learning and developing\
  \ content. But here I am, 6 months into my Kookaberry journey, and I’m a total convert.\
  \ </p>\n<p>I’ll take you through my journey of discovery and show you how Kookaberry\
  \ gives you an easier entry point to MicroPython and embedded systems for beginners,\
  \ more extendable, realistic, and relatable project experiences for your existing\
  \ programmers (without having to get the breadboards out!), and how you can utilise\
  \ Kookaberry in a huge range of cross-curricular applications.</p>"
description: "<p>I’ve spent the last 6 months getting to know the Kookaberry, the\
  \ AustSTEM Foundation’s new MicroPython based embedded system aimed at getting Aussie\
  \ kids engaged with STEM.  </p>\n<p>At first I was reluctant to go all in on the\
  \ Kookaberry, because I could see ways in which it didn’t obviously fit my existing\
  \ content I’d designed for micro:bit, and I simply couldn’t imagine what else I\
  \ would want to build and teach. But once I got past the worry of <em>“what if my\
  \ micro:bit content doesn’t transfer over”</em>, and opened my mind up to the new\
  \ things I could do and the barriers that had been removed, a whole new world of\
  \ possibilities opened up. </p>\n<p>I’ll take you through some of my favourite features\
  \ of the Kookaberry, and how they make all the difference to beginners learning\
  \ about coding and embedded systems for the first time. I’ll also show you how you\
  \ can get students with only a little experience designing and building tech that\
  \ feels like a real prototype (no breadboards required!).</p>\n<p>I’ll discuss some\
  \ of my experiences with Kookaberry in the classroom so far, and my future plans\
  \ for a diverse range of cross-curricular projects for a range of audiences. I hope\
  \ to share with you that this is more than just a gadget for coding, but a new way\
  \ to explore electrical circuits, data collection and analysis, and the intersection\
  \ of everything from music, to sport, to science, alongside technology and code.</p>"
