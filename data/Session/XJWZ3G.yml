abstract: <p>This talk will introduce and demonstrate a selection of procedural content
  generation tools built with Python. From planets, to plants, to pantheons of Gods,
  there is Python code out there to help generate them for you. It doesn't matter
  why you want to generate content, Python is here to help you get more done in less
  time.</p>
description: <p>I'll be covering ready made tools, libraries and open source repositories
  for creating planets, spaceships, plants, cities, Gods and Goddesses, and even some
  examples of more advanced techniques, such as the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm,
  and using Generative Adversarial Networks as part of procedurally generating creative
  content. Don't worry if the last two sound complicated! This isn't a deeply technical
  talk; it's a fun tour of the sorts of creative content that you can make using just
  your computer and some Python code!</p>
