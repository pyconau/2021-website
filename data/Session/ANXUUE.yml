abstract: <p>Learn how to write a Python C extension using pybind11 and package it
  for all major operating systems by building cross-platform wheels.</p>
description: "<p>Have you ever wondered why Python is referred to as CPython and what\
  \ is the Python C-API everyone keeps talking about? Come to this talk and find out!\
  \ We'll briefly take a look at the C-API, how we can use it to extend Python's functionality,\
  \ and how we can write Python C extensions using pybind11.</p>\n<p>After writing\
  \ our Python C extension, we'll package it so users on all major operating systems\
  \ can easily install it using pip. We'll take a look at how we can do this by building\
  \ cross-platform wheels for Linux, macOS, and Windows and automatically pushing\
  \ them to PyPI!</p>"
