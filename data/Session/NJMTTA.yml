abstract: <p>Privacy is about more than just us as individuals. This talk is an ode
  to privacy as a radical political tool to examine and push back against power structures
  in a world obsessed with surveillance.</p>
description: "<p>Privacy has historically been thought of as an <em>individual</em>\
  \ issue: the right to be let alone, to preserve personal autonomy, and an individual's\
  \ ability to keep their business to themselves. </p>\n<p>But we are starting to\
  \ see a shift in the way that privacy is spoken about toward a <em>collective</em>\
  \ concern.  </p>\n<p>In this session, we’ll get nerdy about what privacy can mean\
  \ in the political unrest of the 21st century. We’ll consider how upholding privacy\
  \ is about more than just <em>me</em> and <em>my</em> data, and frame it as an essential\
  \ way to examine and redistribute power, as a form of community care, as political\
  \ resistance to surveillance capitalism and extractive practices of governments,\
  \ and as a tool for harm reduction. </p>\n<p>This session is a call to action for\
  \ attendees to embolden their commitment to privacy as a human right.</p>"
