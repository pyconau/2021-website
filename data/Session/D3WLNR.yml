description: "<p>Legend has it that a vampire cannot enter a home unless they are\
  \ invited to do so.</p>\n<p>Much like vampires, Javascript cannot generally enter\
  \ your web application unless it is invited in. Also like vampires, there are many\
  \ sneaky ways that you may find yourself with <s>a vampire</s> someone else's Javascript\
  \ inside your app without realising you've technically allowed it to be there. What\
  \ happens next may be a bloodsucking nightmare or an eternal, sparkly romance, but\
  \ whatever the outcome it's always better to know how to protect your spaces against\
  \ intruders.</p>\n<p>This session is here to help you solve this problem. Join us\
  \ for a look at the ways that even the best-intentioned developer may leave loopholes\
  \ for unwanted, third-party Javascript to creep into their apps, what that code\
  \ can do when it gets there, and the <s>incantations</s> configurations you can\
  \ deploy to prevent this from happening.</p>"
