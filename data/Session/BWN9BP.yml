abstract: "<p>Django, Flask or FastAPI, ASGI-WSGI, asynchronous-synchronous, protocol\
  \ or web server, workers or threads, gunicorn-uvicorn - <strong>What</strong> is\
  \ going on!? What exactly are these? How do they come along together? Do I even\
  \ need to know about them?</p>\n<p>Developing back-ends for dynamic websites can\
  \ be done in a lot of different ways, and fortunately, python has a great set of\
  \ libraries and packages to help us with the implementation. The problem arises\
  \ when we dive deep and are overwhelmed with the stuff we have at our disposal.</p>\n\
  <p>During this talk, we'll try to find answers to the above questions. We'll take\
  \ a look at the high-level and core features of different parts and understand how\
  \ they are kept compatible with each other to bring out a fantastic web ecosystem.</p>"
description: "<h3>Who's this talk for?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Anyone who wants to start their\
  \ web-development journey in Python (or who has started with Flask or Django, and\
  \ want to explore more).</li>\n<li>People who're wondering what's this <em>\"WSGI\"\
  </em> thing coming up, time and again at different places.</li>\n<li>People who\
  \ want to understand the role of <em>gunicorn</em> or <em>uWSGI</em>, which they\
  \ read about in the deployment docs.</li>\n<li>Anyone who wants a smooth transition\
  \ into asynchronous python web ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Anyone who's overwhelmed with\
  \ terminologies like the ones stated in the first line of Description.</li>\n<li>Anyone\
  \ who isn't really sure how the data flows through the different layers of libraries\
  \ and reach the URL-dispatcher in their favourite framework.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Talk\
  \ Objective</h3>\n<p>The motive is to make the web-developers aware of the different\
  \ parts of the python web ecosystem so that when they face them either while resolving\
  \ a bug and reading logs or when they are going for tweaks to improve performance\
  \ - they'd know in which part they'll have to look out for.</p>\n<h3>Timeline (Outline)</h3>\n\
