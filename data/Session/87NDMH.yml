abstract: <p>This talk is a crash course in teaching and communicating technical topics
  better, regardless of your own technical skill. It was originally part of a workshop
  I delivered for new tutors in my University CS programs, with tips to help students
  learn programming more effectively both in one-on-one and group environments. It
  spans topics from psychology, to lesson design and to communication skills, and
  in the small and the large will help you communicate topics better.</p>
description: "<p>Teaching is hard, and it can be hard to find actionable advice to\
  \ improve. It can also be very useful to have guidelines in your head on how to\
  \ think about teaching. On the other hand, the ability to teach effectively helps\
  \ not only in traditional educational institutions but in how we communicate with\
  \ one another.</p>\n<p>This talk first covers a way of thinking about teaching in\
  \ general that can help keep you focused while explaining a topic to someone else.\
  \ It then covers both general and specific techniques to create an environment where\
  \ teaching is possible. The rest of the talk covers specific places you can focus\
  \ on improving your teaching, from small</p>\n<p>The talk is based on advice given\
  \ to new programming tutors, but some advice can be used across many situations\
  \ -- from explaining a concept to a friend, to giving lectures to hundreds of people.</p>"
