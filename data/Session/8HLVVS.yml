abstract: <p>We are going to go behind the scene of building a data-intensive system.
  The story includes challenges I have faced and what I learned from those incidents.</p>
description: "<p>We always want to do things right at the very first. Have a faultless\
  \ architecture design, 100% test coverage, things like that. However, after running\
  \ a data-intensive system for many years, I realize so many unimaginable things\
  \ can happen in production. </p>\n<p>This talk will help audiences avoid making\
  \ the same mistakes so they donâ€™t suffer as I did. Audiences may be inspired by\
  \ this talk and help them to build a scalable and reliable system that stands the\
  \ test of time.</p>"
