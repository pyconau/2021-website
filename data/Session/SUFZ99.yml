abstract: <p>JAX provides an elegant interface to XLA with automatic differentiation
  allowing extremely high performance machine learning on modern accelerators; all
  from within Python. In this talk we'll give an overview to fundamentals of JAX and
  an intro to some of the libraries being developed on top.</p>
description: <p>JAX is the next generation machine learning library developed by Google
  Research. It provides a pure Python interface to the domain-specific compiler XLA
  (Accelerated Linear Algebra) that targets a range of accelerator hardware including
  GPUs and TPUs (Google's machine learning developed ASIC). Additionally JAX is the
  next generation of the autograd library which provides a rich set of optimisation
  tooling for numerous modern machine learning approaches, with an emphasis on training
  neural networks with gradient descent. This talk will outline the fundamentals of
  JAX programming, demonstrate some of the TPU specific capability for large scale
  distributed training as well as do a  short review of the higher level libraries
  built on top of JAX.</p>
