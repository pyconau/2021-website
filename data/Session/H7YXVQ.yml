abstract: <p>This talk is for software developers who want to understand web security
  fundamentals and prevent common attacks on web projects. We will discuss prepared
  source code examples with an insecure Python backend (and a little insecure JavaScript
  frontend). You don't need prior knowledge.</p>
description: <p>At first, I will give a short overview of <strong>web security fundamentals</strong>
  and explain the <strong>OWASP Top Ten</strong>. Then, we will discuss some prepared
  source code examples (Python-Backend) of common attacks and how to prevent them.
  We will focus on <strong>XSS</strong> (persistent, non-persistent, DOM) and <strong>SQL-Injection</strong>,
  but we will also briefly address <strong>Phishing, DDOS, and CSRF</strong>. Don't
  worry if you are not familiar with these abbreviations yet; I will explain them
  in the talk.</p>
