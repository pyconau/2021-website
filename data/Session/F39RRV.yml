description: "<p>The Python Package Index has taken massive strides as a service since\
  \ its inception in 2002. Through committed volunteer action, two major grants, and\
  \ a bevy of generous hosting providers this service has long established itself\
  \ as a mission critical piece of infrastructure for nearly every Python developer\
  \ globally. This keynote will take some time in retrospect of the growth, trials,\
  \ tribulations, and successes of PyPI in the last twenty years. It will also raise\
  \ to the surface the potential concerns for the sustainability PyPI and some of\
  \ the ways that the Python Software Foundation believes PyPI can continue to reliably\
  \ serve the Python community for the next twenty years.</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n\
