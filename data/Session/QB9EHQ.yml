abstract: "<p>It's at the core of most IT systems that surround us. Without it, nobody\
  \ would know each other on the Internet. And whatever we'd do would not be secure.</p>\n\
  <p>I'm talking about Identification and Authentication. But which options are out\
  \ there to identify and authenticate someone?</p>"
description: <p>Most IT services, such as websites, require us to create some form
  of account. With that, we can later identify ourselves again, and that allows the
  operator to authenticate our identity. But identification and authentication is
  not just between humans and machines, but also between humans and humans, and between
  machines and machines. But what are the different options out there? Surely, there
  is more than username and password or email and password, right? But what else?
  And how do those approaches work? What are their pros and cons? Let's explore them
  and see how they could be implemented in Python.</p>
