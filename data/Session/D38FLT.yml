abstract: <p>I relate the story of a single bit gone wrong back in 2006, which launched
  my career on a new trajectory of root-cause analysis, continuous improvement, and
  DevOps.</p>
description: <p>In 2006 I had just started a new job when a bad release brought every
  one of our hundreds of customers mail servers to its knees. In this talk, I'll walk
  through a high-level "incident postmortem" of this event, the lessons I (and my
  team) learned, and how this years-ago incident changed my career and paved my way
  toward DevOps.</p>
