abstract: <p>Failure is just a fact of running software in production. But you can
  prepare for it in a controlled environment using Chaos Engineering techniques. In
  this talk, you will learn to make use of chaos engineering practices to plan and
  assess your production readiness. This means that you are more ready for the failure
  scenarios, when, not if, they happen.</p>
description: "<p>When you introduce possible breakage scenarios in your infrastructure\
  \ in a controlled fashion, it gives you an opportunity to assess your production\
  \ readiness.</p>\n<p>What happens if your cloud provider's entire availability zone\
  \ goes down?</p>\n<p>When did you last try restoring from your backup?</p>\n<p>Did\
  \ the expected alerts fire? Were the alerts tuned right? Or would it wake your engineer\
  \ up at 3.00 AM for no reason.</p>\n<p>Did you have dashboards setup for the most\
  \ important metrics? Did you even have metrics for that thing you care about?</p>\n\
  <p>By practicing chaos engineering in your software infrastructure, you are essentially\
  \ planning for failure. You plan and assess your readiness for the failure scenarios\
  \ so that you are equipped to better handle them, when, not if, they happen.</p>"
