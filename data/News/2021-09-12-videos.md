The videos from our event are being uploaded now to [our youtube channel](https://youtube.com/pyconau), and they're all available in [this handy playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1LKN2ISCse415LW5FZEjDX2). 

There's also still time to get you [shirt](/shirt). We'll keep our RedBubble storefront open until the end of September 2021, so get your orders in. 

If you still want to live the PyConline AU, you can continue to jam out to our stream music by [cTrix over on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/ctrix).

See you again, hopefully not just online, soon &lt;3
