PyConline AU 2021 could not happen without a cast and crew of almost 100 people working for months to make things happen. 

This includes 60 speakers who spent months drafting, writing and rehearsing their talks, but also our crew of volunteers behind the scenes.

Here's those people (and we apologise in advance if we missed anyone!)

* Our AV team: Ryan Verner from Next Day Video, cTrix (of chiptune fame!!), and our AV volunteers: Michael, Daniel, Patrick, and Jordan. 
    * Thank you! You made us all look and sound amazing!
