# Attend PyConline AU!


As with previous years, we have several types of tickets priced at different levels:

- **Contributor** tickets are our top tier ticket. Contributors are recognised as minor sponsors because the ticket price helps fund outreach and diversity programs (such as covering affordable access for students). This year you can also “pay what you want” above the listed price.
- **Professional** tickets are for professional Python users attending the conference. If your employer is paying for your ticket or you make a living using Python, please consider this tier.
- **Enthusiast** tickets is your ‘general admission’ ticket to the conference, regardless of your python proficiency.
- **Student** tickets are available for anyone enrolled in full or part-time  educational courses at any level. (Where possible, please register using your Australian education institution email address).

Like last year, our event will be hosted on the [Venueless](https://venueless.org/en/) platform, allowing for multiple streaming tracks, text channels, video rooms and more. Your link to Venueless will be on your digital ticket.

The full schedule can be seen over on our [program](/program/). 

Swag is available at our [store](/shirt).

See you online!
