<div class="lede"><p>Django, Flask or FastAPI, ASGI-WSGI, asynchronous-synchronous, protocol or web server, workers or threads, gunicorn-uvicorn - <strong>What</strong> is going on!? What exactly are these? How do they come along together? Do I even need to know about them?</p>
<p>Developing back-ends for dynamic websites can be done in a lot of different ways, and fortunately, python has a great set of libraries and packages to help us with the implementation. The problem arises when we dive deep and are overwhelmed with the stuff we have at our disposal.</p>
<p>During this talk, we'll try to find answers to the above questions. We'll take a look at the high-level and core features of different parts and understand how they are kept compatible with each other to bring out a fantastic web ecosystem.</p></div>

<h3>Who's this talk for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who wants to start their web-development journey in Python (or who has started with Flask or Django, and want to explore more).</li>
<li>People who're wondering what's this <em>"WSGI"</em> thing coming up, time and again at different places.</li>
<li>People who want to understand the role of <em>gunicorn</em> or <em>uWSGI</em>, which they read about in the deployment docs.</li>
<li>Anyone who wants a smooth transition into asynchronous python web ecosystem.</li>
<li>Anyone who's overwhelmed with terminologies like the ones stated in the first line of Description.</li>
<li>Anyone who isn't really sure how the data flows through the different layers of libraries and reach the URL-dispatcher in their favourite framework.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talk Objective</h3>
<p>The motive is to make the web-developers aware of the different parts of the python web ecosystem so that when they face them either while resolving a bug and reading logs or when they are going for tweaks to improve performance - they'd know in which part they'll have to look out for.</p>
